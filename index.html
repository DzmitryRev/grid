                        <p>Born more than 40 years ago as Mr. Natural's 
                           Good Food Store, we're still Missoula's home 
                           for locally-produced, organic and bulk foods. 
                           Now our name's a little shorter. And the storeâ€™s 
                           a lot bigger. But our mission remains the same:
                        </p>

                        <p>The Good Food Store is dedicated to supporting a 
                           healthy community. We provide a wide selection of 
                           organic food and natural products, conduct our 
                           business in an ethical and respectful manner and 
                           donate to organizations in need.
